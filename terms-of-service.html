            <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service or to make a payment to your Notch account through the Site (each such purchase or other transaction, a “Transaction”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Transaction, including without limitation your credit card number, your credit card verification or other security code, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address and your shipping information or bank information.

You agree to pay all charges that may be incurred by you or on your behalf through the Site, at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred, including without limitation all shipping and handling charges. In addition, you remain responsible for any taxes that may be applicable to your Transactions.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, (a) to change product or service descriptions; (b) to limit the available quantity of any product or service; (c) to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code, incentive offer or other promotion; (d) to prevent or prohibit any user or customer from making any or all Transaction(s); and/or (e) to refuse to provide any user or customer with any product or service. Price and availability of any product or service offered through the Site are subject to change without notice. Notch shall not be responsible for any errors in the prices, descriptions or expected delivery time of such products or services.</p>

            <p>Clients may cancel their project and receive a full refund within 30 days of the initial payment, provided that no substantial work or resources have been allocated towards the project. For cancellations after this period, refunds will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <h3>Legal and Export Restrictions</h3>
